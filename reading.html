            <!--USAGE OF THE DEL ELEMENT -->
            This is the best way to buy comics in my opinion. First it allows
            local communities to thrive, it is generally cheaper than buying
            online, and you don&apos;t give your money to greedy corporations
            <del> Amazon </del>. I do have to say this is the most intimidating
            option because it is quite an overwhelming experience to first enter
            and be surrounded by boxes and boxes of old school single issues or
            shelves and shelves of the latest volumes or issues. My tips is to
            not be afraid to be lost and ask questions about how the store is
            set up or have a list of stories you want to try so someone can help
            you find them. Every single comic book store has a different layout
            but they all have an amazing energy I would recommend trying to buy
            from one at least once. My personal favorite is not a local one for
            me but is House of Secrets out in Burbank (image shown on left).

            is the most popular online comic book provider among enthusiasts
            especially in selling Omnibuses/Compendiums. They typically have the
            cheapest online prices compared to others that aren&apos;t
            <del> Amazon </del>. I do have to say there website is quite bad in
            layout but once you find something you want or need than they are
            one of the best options. Another one that is popular is called
            PanelBoundComics they have a ok reputation and more branding than
            inStockTrades but I don&apos;t recommend it as much as
            inStockTrades. PanelBound does frequently run deals especially
            around movie releases so they are worth checking out especially if
            you are avoiding <del> Amazon </del>.

            So the two best <i> legal </i>ways is through Marvel and DC
            subscription based unlimited comic readers that allow you to access
            almost their entire catalog for around $8 a month.

            Not bad for a 100 years worth of stories and experiences with
            various different authors. Almost like a library subscription.
            Speaking of Library, I am unsure of how to fully do this but if you
            have a library card you can connect it to a library app that allows
            you to read the library&apos;s entire comic book collection which
            would be a free way to enjoy three stories. My preferred way that
            I&apos;ve been able to consume these stories is through YouTube
            channels such as
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/@comicstorian"
              title="ComicStorian"
              target="_blank"
              >ComicStorian</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/@comics_explained"
              title="ComicExplained"
              target="_blank"
              >Comics Explained</a
            >
            go through entire stories that essentially give you these stories in
            audiobook form. You don&apos;t get the full experience by seeing
            every panel and many times these channels need to blur the speech
            bubbles but this was a good enough experience for me to fall in love
            with the medium of comic books. A Zero Cost Experience to have my
            entire life flipped around to be obsessed with these amazing
            stories.
