              quite experienced in reading many different comic book stories
              mainly superhero stories. I've been learning quite recently and
              started my own collection recently because a friend showed me his
              impressive collection and it inspired me to start collecting. This
              was also an excuse for me to learn more about the comic medium
              itself so I can be better informed.

          <h3>What are Comics</h3>
          <p>
            Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined
            with text or other visual information. It typically takes the form
            of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech
            balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue,
            narration, sound effects, or other information. There is no
            consensus among theorists and historians on a definition of comics;
            some emphasize the combination of images and text, some
            sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical
            aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring
            characters. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most
            common means of image-making in comics. Photo comics is a form that
            uses photographic images. Common forms include comic strips,
            editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th
            century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, and comic albums,
            have become increasingly common, along with webcomics.

          <h3>Different Types of Comic Books</h3>
          <p>
            There are different types of Comic Books as a medium just like there
            are different type of books. I am going to cover the most common
            types of Comic Books which are
            <a href="#Single Issue">Single Issues </a> <del>Floppies</del>,
            <a href="#Trade Paperback">Trade Paperbacks/Compacts </a>, and
            <a href="#Omnibus">Omnibuses </a>. The main difference between each
            different type of Comic is sizing. Ranging from smallest to lowest,
            we have Single Issues, Trade Paperbacks, and Omnibuses. Depending on
            the story they may have each type of comic book or just certain
            forms mostly dependant on current serilization.

            <dfn>Single Issue or <del>Floppy</del></dfn> your most standrad
            comic book that most people think about when they envision a comic
            book. You can think of Single Issue comics as a single chapter in a
            book. Commonly coming out weekly,biweekly, or monthly. Issues are
            the singular, magazine-style format that you see in comic book
            shops. They are typically 20-30 pages. There is also a special type
            of single issue called a <b>Variant</b>. When a comic book gets sold
            out and needs to be reprinted these companies typically reprint
            these comics with different covers done by different types of
            artists. Making each reprint of the same comic issue exciting the
            different types of art. Typically single issues have a very wide
            range in prices but standard MSRP is around $5-$10 dollars per
            single issue which can get really expensive when collecting.
            Non-standard pricing depends on variants because some people enjoy
            original covers and since they are out of production they can
            skyrocket as a vintage price for over $100+<br />

              I've been made aware by some comic book store employees that you
              should never call a single issue a Floppy it is an ugly word that
              just dervies from the fact that the single issues are floppy in

            <!-- USAGE OF DFN ELEMENT to incase Trade Paperbacks and Compacts -->

            <dfn>Trade Paperbacks</dfn> are a collection of single issues into a
            single <b>Volume</b>. Each Volume usually either denotes the
            finishing of a story arc or story itself. Volumes are several issues
            bound together in a larger format. It takes longer for the volumes
            to release because you have to wait until you have enough single
            issues to justify printing one. There are different volume formats,
            the most typical one is a trade paperback. The other type of trade
            paperbacks are called Compacts. (<i>Image Shown on Right</i>)
            <dfn>Compacts</dfn> are just trade paperbacks but they are the size
            of your average book. So they are shorter and less wide than your
            typical trade paperback. Trade Paperbacks usually range between
            $15-$30 and Compacts usually costs less around the $10-$20 bracket.

          <!--USAGE OF THE DFN ELEMENT ATTRIBUTE-->
          <p>
            A comic <dfn>Omnibus or Compendium</dfn> is an oversized, hardcover
            book that collects a large number of comic book issues into a single
            volume. Unlike smaller trade paperbacks (TPBs) that typically
            compile a single story arc, an omnibus often collects an entire
            series or a significant run by a particular writer or artist. An
            omnibus is basically a collection of comic book issues or story arcs
            all bundled up into one massive, jaw-dropping book. It is like the
            comic book version of an all-you-can-eat buffet, but instead of
            unlimited shrimp cocktails, you get an unlimited feast of awesome
            artwork and epic storytelling. So in other words you can call
            Omnibuses a collection of volumes or a large collection of single
            issues. For example some Omnibuses can contain between 5-6 Volumes
            or 30-40 Single Issues worth of content. These are usually
            significantly more expensive for an upfront cost for obvious reasons
            that it is a much larger book but usually it would condense to be a
            cheaper alternative than buying every single volume or every single
            issue contained within that Omnibus. Many of these range between $70
            and $200.
