              comics is to find and choose a character that you are interested
              in or an author that writes great stories. These recommendations
              are a mix of really popular series and my favorite superheroes.
              Like my favorite superhero of all time is Batman so I have a lot
              of Batman centric stories I would like to share and others. I will
              be recommending different heroes for the sake of variety.

            Absolute Batman is part of a DC Universe reset where Darkseid
            recreates the every superheros origin and world. We essentially are
            stripping core aspects of every major superhero but leaving them
            with their morals. Everyone always talks about how Batman&apos;s
            Superpower is being a billionaire well this story tackles, what if
            Batman wasn&apos;t rich. How does Batman tackle his issues without
            his super advanced tech. How does Batman tackle his villians without
            the years of Tibetan Monk Training. What differences are his
            villians now. The series stars a 24-year-old blue-collar civil
            engineer named Bruce Wayne, who operates at night to fight crime as
            the vigilante Batman with his own self-designed equipment and armor.
            The solution what if we made Batman absolutely jacked and made him
            the ultimate civil servant where he has worked in every single blue
            collar section of Gotham that he knows Gotham from the back of his
            hand. This story is an absolute blast to read and the flips on every
            villian is so jaw-dropping. Once you see an image of absolute
            Mr.Freeze looking like Slenderman had sex with a blue man you
            won&apos;t be able to put down the story. Currently has 12 single
            issues out right now with a single Volume covering issues #1-6. This

            "Blackest Night" is a 2009 American comic book crossover storyline
            published by DC Comics, consisting of an eponymous central
            miniseries, written by

            and penciled by Ivan Reis, along with a number of tie-in issues of
            various DC monthly books, including Green Lantern and Green Lantern
            Corps."Blackest Night" involves Nekron, a personified force of death
            who reanimates deceased superheroes and seeks to eliminate all life
            and emotion from the universe. Johns identified the series' central
            theme as emotion. Other tie-ins released included an audio drama
            from Darker Projects. Blackest Night is THE green lantern book
            centered around my favorite green lantern Kyle Reyner. Blackest
            Night is a pivotal book in green lantern history that establishes so
            much of the world and allows you to understand every single lantern
            in the emotional spectrum. Not only is it an amazing green lantern
            book this is a crossover storyline so we get to see many of our
            favorite heroes get brought in as different lanterns or as the main
            driving force of the story life vs death. The white lanterns vs the
            black lanterns.

            takes on Bludhaven's most famous vigilante, Nightwing! After coming
            into billions of dollars, Dick Grayson has a plan to save his city
            that doesn't involve punching bad guys...well, that doesn't involve
            ONLY punching bad guys. Nightwing also known as Dick Grayson
            formerly the boy wonder Robin is the first protege under Batman's
            wing. In this story, Alfred Pennyworth bestowed upon Dick an immense
            fortune essentially turning him into a mini Batman money wise. This
            story tackles essential story beats such as greif, expetation, and
            improvement. Nightwing is the ideal superhero, he is Batman if
            Batman knew how to tackle his trauma in a constructive way. Tom
            Taylor really allows Nightwing to come into his own as a character
            while also freeing him from the shackles that is being in
            Batman&apos;s shadow.

            Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by
            Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor

            and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic
            book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic
            Books. Considered one of the most popular and commercially
            successful superheroes, he has been featured in comic books,
            television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays. Spider-Man
            has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker who was raised by
            his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in Queens, New York City after the death
            of his parents. Lee, Ditko, and later writers had the character deal
            with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood. His
            "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were
            issues with which young readers could identify. Unlike previous teen
            heroes, Spider-Man was not a sidekick nor did he have a mentor. He
            would be given many supporting characters, such as his Daily Bugle
            boss J. Jonah Jameson; friends like Harry Osborn and Flash Thompson;
            romantic interests like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
            Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and
            Venom. close.
