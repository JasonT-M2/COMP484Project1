              >Authors are literally the foundations of these amazing stories
              and medium. Authors and Artists work in tandem to bring the comic
              book medium into the beautiful vision it is now today. Authors
              create these amazing compelling stories while Artists allow us to
              visualize the absolute absurdity or beauty that is Comic Books.
              Here I highlight my current favorite authors that have created
              either my favorite stories or favorite heroes. Many of these
              authors are legends with at least 1 super recognizable
              Intellectual Property they have worked with or popular story.

            <b>Stan Lee</b> is an absolute marvel legend. In collaboration with
            others at Marvel, particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and
            Steve Ditko, he co-created iconic characters, including
            <a

              >Spider-Man,</a
            >
            the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the
            Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the
            Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters'
            introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in
            superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of
            the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its
            policies. In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel
            properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his
            retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public
            figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in
            films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he
            received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become
            the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. He continued
            independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee
            was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall
            of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received
            the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008. He is without a single
            doubt the grandfather of comic books. The most recognizable author
            for very much good reason.

            comics. Tom Taylor personally is one of my favorite authors and made
            me grow to love one of my favorite superheros, the former boy
            wonder, Nightwing. As recommended in the recommendation section his
            series run of
            <a

              title="Nightwing"

            ever written. An underrated story he's written is Dark Knights of

            <b>Scott Snyder</b> (born January 15, 1976) is an American comic
            book author. He is known for his 2006 short story collection Voodoo
            Heart, and his work for DC Comics, including series such as American
            Vampire, Detective Comics, a highly acclaimed run on Batman, Swamp
            Thing, and Justice League as well as the company-wide crossover
            storylines "Dark Nights: Metal" and "Dark Nights: Death Metal." He
            has also written creator-owned comics published through Image
            Comics, including Wytches, Undiscovered Country, and Nocterra. As
            part of his DC work, he co-created the characters, The Batman Who
            Laughs, Mr. Bloom, and the Court of Owls. Scott Snyder is quite
            literally in my opinion the best Batman author. No one can compete
            with how Scott Snyder writes the Caped Crusader. His Take on Batman
            is unmatched with his world building of Gotham down to the absolute
            insane batman villians this man creates. The Batman who Laughs and
            the whole DC Dark Metal Event Story is an absolute trip to go on and
            still grounds itself as a Batman story. Thus another author I have
            recommended in my recommendation section his
            <a
              href="recommendation.html#Absolute Batman"

              >Absolute Batman series</a
            >
            that is currently seralizing is one of the best stories I have ever
            read about Batman.

            <b>Geoff Johns</b> is an absolute DC legend. Geoffrey Johns (born
            January 25, 1973) is an American comic book writer, screenwriter,
            and film and television producer. Johns's work on the DC Comics
            characters Green Lantern, Aquaman, The Flash, and Superman has drawn
            critical acclaim.[2]His critically acclaimed work includes Sinestro
            Corps War, Blackest Night, Throne of Atlantis, Flashpoint, Doomsday
            Clock, Superman: Last Sonand Superman: Brainiac. He co-created the
            DC character Courtney Whitmore based on his deceased sister. He also
            expanded the Green Lantern mythology, adding in new concepts and
            co-creating numerous characters. Among the DC characters and
            concepts he co-created are Larfleeze, the Sinestro Corps, the Indigo
            Tribe, the Red Lantern Corps, Atrocitus, the Black Lantern Corps,
            Jessica Cruz, Hunter Zolomon, Tar Pit, Simon Baz, Bleez, Miss
            Martian, Kate Kane, and Christopher Kent. Geoff Johns is the DC
            equivalent to Stan Lee Marvel Prowess. Ok that us a bit of an
            exaggeration but this man is still one of the greatest comic authors
            of all time. His work on Flash, Superman, and ESPECIALLY GREEN
            LANTERN is unmatched with how much his world building has affected
            the DC universe in its entireity. His stories build the DC universe
            brick by brick. Once again, an Author I like is already on my
            recommendation list but it is not without fail because
            <a
              href="recommendation.html#Blackest Night"
              title="Blackest Night"
              target="_parent"
              >Blackest Night</a
            >
            is hands down the best Green Lantern Comic and it doesnt even come
            close.
